message in console.log saved now the product will be saved and we will get the notification in the termin Al now we will generate the response for the front end to generate the response we will add response. Json method and in this one we will pass one object so in this object we will add success that will be true and the product name that we have added so here we will type request dot body dot name now the response will be generated in Json format the key will be success and value will be true now using this product schema we have created one new product and we have saved this product in database after that we will console log saved and then we will generate one response with the key success and name success will be true and in this name we will get the product name after that we will test this API so let's again come to thunder client and we will click on new request this will be post and here we will provide the endp point that will be HTTP Local Host 4,000 SL add product and in this body we have to send one object in Json format so first we'll send the product name so we'll add name and in this value we will type product 1 2 3 then we have to add one ID so let's add the ID any

create one logic using that we don't have to provide this ID this ID will be automatically generated in the database for that here we will find all the products so just type let products is equal to await and we will use the product schema and find method in this find method we will pass one empty object using that we will get all the products in one aray and we can access that using this products for now we have only BR product so in this products we will get that product in aray if we have two product we will get both products in this array after that we will create one ID variable and first we will check if products do length If the product length is greater than zero it means the product is available in our database from that product list we will find the latest product and from that ID we will get the value and in this ID we will add one increased value for that we will typ late last product array is equal to products do slice and here we will provide minus one so in the array we will get only one product that will be the last product now from this product are a we will store it in any variable so just add let last product is equal to last product array and we will provide the index number zero because we have only one product and we can access it using zero index now we will get that product and from this last product we can generate the ID so here we will type ID is equal to last product do id+ one so whatever the product ID will be for the last product we will increment it by one and we will generate our new ID while creating this product we don't have to take the ID from request here we will type ID now if there is any product in the database we will get the ID and we will create a new ID by incrementing it by one but if the database has no

Json method after that we will get the pass data so here we will add dot then and here also we will add one Aro function and in this one we will add data that is the pass data and we will save this data in our response data variable so let's add response data is equal to data that we got through promise that we have got through promise after that in the promise we will get the image URL and success true or false so we have to check if response data dot success if it is true it means our image has been saved in the multer image storage and we will get the URL of that image so here we will add product. image is equal to and we will add response data dot image URL that we will get through backend so after adding the product image our object will be completed where we have category and image is empty so in this image we will use the image URL that we will get through upload inpoint this name we are getting from this title field and price from these price input field then this object will be completed so after that here we will add console.log and our product now we will come back to admin panel and refresh the web page and here if we type test 1 2 3 price we will add 100 and offer price 50 and here we will select any image then click on ADD button and inspect console and in this object we have the category then here we have the image URL let me open this URL in the new tab so you can see we have the image that we have uploaded it means our upload end point is successfully working now we have received the product now we can send this product in add product endpoint so for that we will use the fetch API so we will type await Fetch and here we will pass the address of our endpoint so we will type HTTP Local Host 400 000 slash add product so this is the add product endpoint after that we will pass one object and here we will use the method post after that we will add header and in this one we will save one object and here we will type accept application G and after that we will add content type and here we will provide application G so we have to wrap this content type as string after that here we will add the body property and in this body property we will use the product data so our product data is in Json format so first we will stringify that data for that we will use Json do a stringify and in this one we will pass the product so after that this product will be sent on this end point and after that our backend will upload our product in the DV database after that we will get one promise so here we will add dot then and here we will pass the promise that is response and first we will parse this response for that we will use response. Json after that we will get another promise and we will get the P response for that here we will create one Arrow function and here we will add the data and in this Aro function first we will check if our data do success is true in this case we will alert and in this alert we will add one text product added if the data do success is false in that case here we will add alert and here we will pass one message failed here we have used the turn operator data do success if it is true then it will alert product added if it is false it will display failed now save this and now again come back and here we will add another product so let's type kids product let's say let's keep the same price select the category kid and we will select the image and then we will click on ADD button so you can see the alert product added now let's check it so this product has been added in our database so let's open our vs code and here in this backend message we have the ID 26 and here we have the date and available true and this product has been added in our database to check the product we will open our mongodb Atlas database then we will go to database and here we will click on browse collection so in this products we have product ID 26 that we have recently added using the admin panel and here we have the product image if we open this image so you can see the same image that we have uploaded from the admin panel now our admin panel is successfully working that we have connected using the backend now we'll create the product list component using that we can display all the uploaded products and if you want to remove the product we can remove it from here now we will Design our list product component so let's open list product. jsx file and here within this div we will create the HML structure for this component so in this div we will add one H1 tag one H1 tag and in this H1 tag we will type all products list then save the changes here you can see all product list now we can easily navigate between ADD product and product list component using the react router in this div we will add another div with the class name list products format main inside this div we will create six paragraph tag for that we will add P into six so in the first one we will add products then we will use the title then we will add old price then we will provide the new price after that we will provide category and here we will provide the remove now save this so here we have the product title old price new price category and remove after this div we will create another div with the class name list product all products and this div we will map our product data that we will fetch using the API so here we will add one HR tag and after that we will map the product data that we will get from the API so here we will add the logic using that we can fix the data from API so first we will create one state variable we will add con all products and here we will add the function name set all products is equal to use State and here we will initialize it with empty array after that we will create one function using that we can fetch the data from API and save the data in this state variable for that we will use the arrow function so we will add const fetch info and we will add one async Arrow function after that here we will use the F API so we will use await fetch and in this we have to pass the endpoint address that is HTTP Local Host Port 4,000 SL all products after that we will use dot then method and in this one we will pass the response after getting the response we will pass this response for that we will use response. Json method after that we will get another promise so we will add dot then and in this one we will pass that promise so here we'll add data then addo function and after getting this data we will set this data in the set all products so here we will add set all products and in this one we will pass this data so this fetch will be completed after that we will arrange it so here using this fetch request we are getting the response and we have converted it using Json then we have saved this data in all product State variable after that we have to run this function whenever this component is mounted for that we will use the use effect and here we will pass one Arrow function and here we will call The Fitch info function now we want this function to be executed only once so here we will add one square bracket and here we will add all products we will map this all products data in this map we will pass one Arrow function and here we will pass one individual product and index so we will get the product now we will create one template where we will map all the products for that here first we will add return and in this return we will pass one div and the class name will be list product format Main in this class name we will add one more class name that will be list product format after that we are doing the mapping so here we will pass the key property and here we will add the index that we have passed through parameter so in this div first we will insert one image tag tag and we will provide one class name list product product icon in this image SRC we will add the image URL that we will get from the API so here we will type product do image after that we will create one paragraph tag and in this paragraph tag we will insert the product title so let's add product dot name after that we will add one more paragraph tag and in this one we will provide the old price for that here we will add dollar and then we will insert then we will use the curly bres and insert the price using product. old price similarly we will add one more P tag and here also we will add dollar then curly veres and here we will provide the product dot new price after that we will add one more P tag and here we will display the product category for that here we will type product dot category after that we will add one image tag so let's add IMG and in this image tag we will add one class name and we will use the class name list product remove icon now in this SRC we will insert the cross icon so first we have to import that icon so we will type import cross IC icon from assets folder SL cross icon.png after that we will use this cross icon here so in this SRC we will add curly bres and cross icon after that save this and we will come back to the web page so here you can see whatever products we have added for testing that is displaying on this web page after that we will add the CSS properties for the product list component so let's open list product. CSS file and first We'll add the CSS properties for the list product class name so here we will type do list product and here we will provide display Flex Flex Direction column align items Center width 100% height 740 pixel padding 10 pixel and 50 pixel margin of 30 pixel B radius 6 pixel background it will be white and save the changes now we have added the CSS properties for this container after that we will add the CSS properties for this list product format Main class name so just copy this class name and place it here in this CSS file so here we will add display grid grid template column it will be one fraction three fraction one fraction one fraction one fraction and one fraction after that we will provide the gap of 10 pixel width will be 100% padding will be 20 pixel and 0 pixel color and add this color code then we will change the font size it will be 15 pixel and font weight will be 600 now save the changes now you can see the format is ready all contents are aligned horizontally we have the product image product title old price new price category and remove icon after that we will add the CSS properties for this L product format class name so let's copy this class name and place it here dot list product format and here we will use align item Center and font weight 500 save the changes so we have moved the text in center now we will add the CSS property for this image tag so here we we have the class name list product product icon and paste it here in the CSS file here we will provide the height 80 pixel then save the changes and we will come to the web browser so you can see we have reduced the size of this image after that that we will add the CSS properties for this cross icon so let's copy this class name and add it here here we will provide cursor pointer and margin Auto after that save the changes so we have added the cursor pointer on this cross icon and margin Auto now we will add the CSS properties for the max width 800 pixel so let's reduce the screen width under 8800 pixel so here we will add media and here we will add the condition Max width 800 pixel so first we will add the CSS property is for list product class name we will add the Box sizing border box width 95% height 100% padding 10 pixel and 30 pixel margin will be 20 pixel and Auto after that save the changes now this is how it is looking in the small device now we will add the CSS properties for the list product format so let's come back and here we will add the class name list product format Main and here we will provide the padding 15 pixel and zero then we will then we will add the color code and after that we will use the font size this will be 12 pixel and save the changes now the text size has been reduced now we will add the CSS properties for this image so here we will add dot list product product icon and here we will provide the height of 60 pixel save the changes so as you can see if we scroll this our product is going Beyond this container so to fix this one here we will add Dot list product all product and in this all products container we will use overflow y Auto then save the changes now we can scroll this product list now we will come to L product. jsx file and after this diff tag after this D tag we will insert one HR tag and here we can return only one component and we are returning two so here we will use one empty tag and we will close it here after this HR so here we have wrapped the div and HR tag in this empty tag and we will save it now we will come to web page so here we have the so here we have the line after a product now let's add one more product so here we will type kids product testing for list product component here we will add the price 20 and 10 category will be men and here we'll add one image and click on ADD button so here we have the message product added and we will come to product list and here you can see at the end we have the product that we have just added product image name price category and cross iccon now this cross icon is not functional so now we have to make it functional for that we will come to list product. jsx file and here we will create one function and the function name will be remove product so we will add const remove product so this will be one asnc Arrow function and here we will use the remove product API for that we will use await Fetch and in this fet we will pass the endp point name so we will add HTTP Local Host then port number slash remove product we have already created this endpoint then comma and here we will add one object and in this object we will Define the method that will be post method after that we will add headers and in the header we will provide one object and here we will add accept application Json after that we will add content type and here also we will add application J after this header we will add body and in this body we will provide the product ID so we will add Json do a stringify and in this one we will provide one object where we will add the ID and in this ID we will use the ID parameter that we will receive in this parameter so we'll add ID so from this parameter we will take the ID and we will provide this ID in this value now we will link this remove product function with the cross icon so in this IMG tag we will add on click property and in this one we'll pass one Arrow function and in this Aro function we will provide the remove product function and in this parameter we will provide the ID so we'll add product. ID after that when the product will be removed we will we will call this fetch info function again so that our list will be updated so here we will add fetch info and here we will use await now save the changes now we will open our web browser and here if I click on cross icon let's click on the first one that product will be removed from the database and also from this product list let's click again you can see these products will be removed now we have only two products and now if I refresh you can see still we have only two products in the admin panel now if we open the database and go to products let me me refresh the web page and here you can see we have only two products now our admin panel is successfully working now we will remove all the products and let's add the old product in our database so we have removed all the products now we'll go to add product and we will add the new product so one by one we will add the new product and we will add all the data in the database so for that we will add one title and here we will add price then we will select the category and image that will be the product image let me select the product one and select add then you can see message product added similarly we will add another image then click on ADD similarly we will add all our products in the database now we have added all our products in the database you can see all products are visible in this product list we have the product icon title price category and remove icon now we have successfully created the admin panel of our e-commerce website after that we will create the apis for the e-commerce project such as login and to save the cart items in our database so let's close our admin panel codes after that we will close this folder that is admin folder and here we will start and here we will stop our admin panel now the back end is running now in this back end we will create multiple apis for user creation login and to save the cart items in the database so first we'll create the API for the user creation so here we will use the users schema so to create the user schema we will add one comment schema creating for user model then we will add con users is equal to mongus do model and here we will add users then we will provide one object and in this object we will Define the structure of the user so in the user we will add the user's name so let's add name and here we will add one object and in this object we will Define the type so the type will be string then we will add the email property and the type will be a string and then we will add the unique true so if any user will create an account with one email ID then he will then he cannot create the another account with the same email ID now we will add the password property and in this password property we will add type string after that user should have the card data so let's add one object and in this object We'll add the type object after that we will add the date and the type will be date and here we will add default value that will be the current date so we will add date do now that will provide the date of user creation so we have created the user schema where we have the name email password cart data and date after that we will create the API using that we can create the user so here we will add one comment and here we will add creating endpoint for registering the user after that we will use app. post method in this one we will provide the path of the Endo so we will slash so we will provide SL signup and here we will provide one snc Arrow function so let's add async and here we'll pass the parameter request and response so in the sign up first we will check the email ID and password that we are getting that are already existing or not so to check that we'll add let check is equal to a wait and here we will use the user models and find one method and in the find one we will provide one object and to check the email we will type email and here we will add the users email so here we will provide the request dot body. email so if any account is already available with this email ID then we will get the data in this check so first we will check and after that we'll add if in this if we'll add check and here we'll add response do a status so we will return it and we will add the status 400 and we will add do Json we will use the Json method and in this Json we will provide one object and in this object we will add one key success and here we will provide false because we have not created any account and we will add success false it will be a error so let's add error and in this errors we will add one string existing user found with same email ID or email address so if the email address is already used then we are generating one response where we have the success false and error message after that if there is no error then we will create let cart is equal to empty object and then we'll run one for Loop for this for Loop we will provide the index I and here we will run it 300 times and in this one we will provide cart index is equal to 0 using this it will create empty object where we will get the keys from 1 to 300 so we have created the empty card data now now we will create the user using the users model so we'll add const user is equal to new users in this one we will provide one object and here we will add name it will be request. body. username then we will add email field and here we will use request. body. email after that we will add password field and here we will use request. body. password after that we will use the cart data in this cart data we will use this cart object so we'll add cart now the user will be created after that we have to save the user in the database so we'll add await user. save so after creating the user we will use the JWT authentication to use the JWT authentication we will create one data so let's add con data is equal to CES and in this one we will create one key and the name will be user and in this key we will store one object in this object we will create one ID and here we will use the user ID after getting this data here we will create the token to create the token we will use const token is equal to JWT DOT sign method and in this one we will provide the data object that we have created here and after that we will add salt when we use this Sol our data will be encrypted by one layer so in this one we will add secret Ecom and then the token will be generated after generating the token we will create the response and here we'll use the Json property and in this response we will send one object where we will add success true and token using this API we will create the user so in this API first we are checking whether the user has this already existing account if it is there then we will response with success false error message if there is no user then we will create one empty card and using this card we will create the user user where we will add the name email password and cart data after that this created user will be saved in the database using this do save method and after that we are creating the token using this object that is the data object we we have the user key and in this user key we have one object with the ID and user ID after the data object creation we are generating the token for that we are using JWT sign method and here we have passed this data object and here we have added the salt using that our token will not be readable then we have added one response where we have sent the object and in this object we have success token in this object we have success true and token now we will test this API for that let's save this code and restart the server now you can see Server running on Port 4,000 now we will open the Thunder client and click on new request select the post and here we will use the a API endpoint so we will type HTTP Local Host 4,000 SL sign up after that in this body we will send one object so first we will add one user name and in this username we will provide checking user after that we will add the password field in this password field we will add one password so here we will use the strong password so here we will use one simple password then we will add one email field in this email field we will add one email that is user. greatest tack at gmail.com so here we have username password and email then we'll click on the send button so here we have the success true and now we have generated one token now if I click again on the send button you can see the message success Falls existing user found with the same email address it means we have already created the account using this same email ID and and we are again trying to create one account with the same email ID that's why we getting this message and here if I change the user to. greatest T and click on send you can see another account will be created and we will get another token it means our signup is successfully working now we will come back to the browser and refresh this and here we have the products model and we have we have the users model so in this users in this users we have two users email address password email address password and name so we have two users saved in our database after that we will create the endpoint for the user login for that here we will add one comment so let's type creating endpoint for user login now we'll create the Endo for the user login and here we will use app. post method and here we will provide the endpoint path that will be/ login and here we will pass one async Arrow function in this parameter we will pass the request and response here first we will use the email address that we will get from the API so let's use let user is equal to await and here we will use users model Dot find one method and in this method we will add one filter that will be one object and in this one we will add the key email and in this email we will provide the request. body do email so using this statement we will get the user related to the particular email ID and it will be stored in the user variable after storing that user here we will add one if statement and in this condition we will add user if we get any user we will execute this if statement so in this one first we will compare the password of that user for that here we will add con pass compare is equal Al to request do body dot password triple equal to user dot password so whatever password we are getting from the API and users registered password we are comparing if both are same this pass compared will be true after this statement we will check if pass compare if this is true in that case we will add one data object so let's add const data is equal to one object and in this object we will use the key that is user and in this one we will store one object and here we will add the ID property and in this one we will save user. ID so after comparing the password if it is true this will create this user object and now we will use the JWT to create the token so we'll add const token is equal to zwt Dot sign function and in this one we will pass the data and with that we will pass the salt so last time we have used secret Ecom so again we are using the same thing now the token will be generated and then we'll create one response using the Json property and in this response we will pass success true and our token if the password is same then it will be true and the response will be generated where we will get success true and token after that if the password is incorrect so in that case we will add else condition and here we will generate response do Json and here we will provide one object where the success will be false and after that we will add one error message in this errors we will add wrong password and it will generate one response if the password is wrong then success will be false and in the error we will add wrong password after that we will add one else statement for this if if this user is not available with this email ID in that case we will add one elsea statement and here we will add response Json method then we will add one object and in this one we will add success false and after that we'll add the errors and in this errors we will add wrong email ID after that save this changes now our endpoint SL login is ready where we are finding the user and then we are comparing the password and if the password is correct then we will generate one token and if the password is incorrect we will display the error wrong password and if the user is not available with the particular email ID then we will display wrong email ID after that we will save this file and restart our server now server has been started and here we will click on new request and here we will select post method and here we will use the endpoint SL login and in this body we will provide the object in this object we will provide one email ID so last time we have used used one email ID that we are using again user do greatest tack at gmail.com after that we will add one password key and in this password we will add our correct password now if I click on send you can see the login is success true and we will get the token now if I enter any wrong password and click on send you can see success false entered message is wrong password now if I collect the password and click on send again we will get the success now if I enter any incorrect email ID and click on send you can see success fals and errors message is wrong email ID now if I correct it and click on send you can see success true and we will get the token it means our login endpoint is successfully working now we have created this sign up and login endpoint now we will merge this endpoint with with our e-commerce website to link the API in front end we will open the front end folder and in this folder we will open the integrated terminal so right click and open in integrated terminal so first we will run our front-end project to run that project here we will type npm start command so here our project is running in the browser so we'll click on login page and open this login. jsx file that is in the pages folder so we'll open login sign up. jsx so first we have to create the feature for this login here button so that we can login and sign up from the same page for that we will come back to the vs code editor and here we will add one state variable and the name will be state so we will add const State and the set function name will be set a state is equal to user State and we will initialize it with login so we have created one state variable and initialized it with login string now instead of this sign up we will use our state so let's add a state now save it now we'll open the web browser so you can see we have the login text that is coming from our state now if I change it make it sign up so here our text is sign up now if now we want the name input field will be in the sign up but it will be hidden from the login page so let's change it to login and after that here in this input field where we have added the name input field we will use the Turner operator and here first we will check for the state if it is sign up then we will keep this input field else we will hide it for that we will add one question mark and we will place it here after this question mark So if the state is sign up then only this input field will be visible if it is not signed up in that case we will add one empty tag after that we will save the changes so this is our login page where we have the email and password field then continue button after that we have this login here link so we'll create a new paragraph So let's come back and we'll create a new copy of this paragraph tag and here we will update the text it will be create an account and after that here we will add the text click here after that save the changes so here we have two options already have an account login here create an account click here now from this login page we have to hide this text and on the sign up page we have to hide this text so for that we will add one inary operator after this button so here we will check the state if our state is sign up in that case we have to display this paragraph text already have an account so cut this and paste it here after this question mark after that here we will use Colum and then insert this second paragraph after this colum now save the changes so here you can see we are on the login page and here we have the option create an account click here now we will add the functionality if we will click here our login page will be converted in the sign up page for that let's come back and we have to add the onclick property in this Span in both span tag so here we'll add the arrow function and here where we have the login here we will add set a state and in this one we will set the state login and in the second one we will add set a state and here we will set the State sign up after that save this and now come back now come back to the web page and if I click here you can see we are on the sign up page and here we have the option already have an account login here click here and now we will come back to the login page now this login sign up page is successfully working now we have to add the API for the login sign up a page for that we will come back to the vs code editor and here we will add two add a function that will be for the login and sign up so here we will type const login and this will be one asynchronous Arrow function so we'll add async then create one Arrow function and we will create another copy of this and here we will add the names sign up we have created two function after that in this continue button we will add onclick property and in this onclick property we will pass one Arrow function and here we will use the tary operator so first we will check for the state if our state is login in that case we will call the login function if a state is not login in that case we will call the signup function after that here we will add one console log we will add login function executed and in in the second one we will add sign up function executed after that save the changes and we will come back to the web browser and we will open the console Tab and if I click on continue it is displaying login function executed if I click on button from this signup page it is displaying signup function executed it means our login and sign of function is properly working now after that we'll add one state variable for the input field data now we will create the variable to save our input field data for that here we'll add const and we'll add the variable name form data and here we will add the set a function name set form data is equal to user State and here we will initialize it with one object and in this object first we will use the username and we will initialize it with empty string then we will add the password property and here also the password will be empty string then we will add the email and here also it will be empty string after that we will use this form data to get the data from the input field so to get the data from the input field we will use the onchange property for that we have to create the change Handler function so here we will create one const change Handler and this will be one Arrow function in this parameter we will pass the event that will be the input field and here we will add set form data and in this one we will use the spread operator for the user field to update the username password and input field so here we will add form data then we will add the field name that will be e do Target dotame and in the value we will provide e do target. value after that we will add the name in this input field and in this name we will provide username after that we'll add the value property and in this one we'll provide the form data dot username after that we will add the onchange property so we'll add on change and in this one we'll pass the change Handler function s Sly in this second input field we will add name and here we will provide email after that we will use value and in this value we will use the form data dot email property after that here also we will add the on change and in this on change we will provide change Handler function similarly in this password field we will add the name password value will be form data dot password then we will add the onchange property and here we will provide the change Handler so using this name property our Handler function will update the fields after that execution of this login function we will update the form data similarly we will update the form data in this sign up now save the changes and come back to the web page and here if I click on inspect and open the console Tab and here we will add email ID email gmail.com and some password and click on continue you can see in the console we have the email ID and password and if I click on this link and here we will add the name greatest tag and click on continue so here we have the data email password and username now we are getting the data from our input field now we have to create the login and signup now we have to create the login and signup function so first we'll create the signup function so here we'll create one variable and we'll add the name let response data and and after that we will use fetch API so here we'll add a wait Fetch and in this one we will pass the end point of our sign up that will be HTTP Local Host Port 4,000 SL sign up so this is the sign up end point then we'll add one object and here we have to define the method so we'll add the method post after that we will add the headers and in the header we will provide one object and in this object we will add accept and here we will provide application form data after that we will add content type and here we will add applic Jon after this headers we will add the body property and in this body we will provide the form data so let's add form data so first we have to stringify this form data for that we will use jon. a stringify and in this one we will add form data and we have added the form data in this a stringify method after doing this fetch we will get a response to get that response we will add do then method and here we will pass the response and first we will pass this response so we will use response. Json method after that we'll get the pass data so we'll add then and here we'll pass the arrow function we will add data and in this and and we will save this pass data in our response data so here we will type response data is equal to data so now this pass data will be saved in our response data variable after that we will check if response data dot success if it is true it means our username and password is correct and the token has been generated in that case here we will add the authen authentication token in the local storage for that we will add local storage dot set item and here we will add the key name so we'll add o token and in this o token we will save response data dot token so now the O token will be saved and uh after that we will be logged in in our web page after login we will send the user to homepage for that we'll use window.location do dplace and here we will provide the path of homepage after that we will save it and now we will come back to the sign up page and here we will create one account so we will type the username creest tag and in this email we will provide user. grest tag at gmail.com let's add user 3 and in this password We'll add any password then click on continue so now we are logged in on our web page and our token one has been generated so to check the token we'll go to application and here we'll see local storage and in this local storage you can see o token has been saved in local storage so this is the key and value and in the value we have the all token that we have generated from the API now let's delete it and we'll click on login and uh if the response is Success this Au token will be generated and we will and we will be navigated to the homepage else the navigation if the authentication is not success then we will alert so in this alert we will provide the error message so here we will type response data dot errors save the changes and here if we add the same email ID and try to create the account with the same email ID so user 3. greatest tack at gmail.com and here we will add one password and click on continue you can see we will get the error message existing user found with the same email address it means our sign up function is successfully working after that we'll create the login function so to create the login function we'll come back to the login function and for that we will use the same method as signup function so let's copy this and paste it here in this login function and here we will update the path it is login this is the login endpoint now save this and we'll come back to the web page here we have the email that we have used to log in last time now we'll click on continue button now we are logged in on our web page and we are on the homepage now if I click inspect and go to and go to to application local storage Port 3000 and here we have the authentication token now the login function is successfully working after that we will create the log out functionality for that we will come back to the vs code editor and here we will open the Navar component here we will use the turn operator and here we will check if our local storage has one o token available then we will display the logout button so first We'll add local storage do get item o token so if this o token is available in the local storage in that case we will display one button tag and in this button tag we'll add log out and in this button tag We'll add on click property and here we'll pass one Arrow function so to log out from the web page we will remove this local storage so here we'll add local storage. remove item and here we will provide the O token and with this we have to redirect the user to the homepage so we'll add window do location do replace and here we will add the path of the homepage that is slash after that we will add the colum if the O token is not available in that case we will display this tag after this colum that is the login button so if the O token is available this log out button will be displayed if Au token is not available then this login button will be displayed after that save the changes and we will come back to the home page and here we have the O token available and here we have the log out option if I click here so our o token will be deleted and here we have the login button and and if I login here with the email ID and password and click on continue so again you can see the log out button here we have the Au token generated in the local storage now this login and log out function is successfully working so if we enter the wrong password then we'll get the option wrong password and if we enter the correct password and click on continue so we are logged in and our Au token has been generated so we have linked our login and logout API with our e-commerce website now we have created the login and log out functionality for our website now we will add the all products data using all product API then we will display the product on our e-commerce website for that we will come back to the vs code editor and here we will open the context folder that then open sop context in this sop context provider function we will create one state variable so here we will add const all product and for the setter function we will add set all product is equal to user State and we will initialize it with empty aray so we will remove this imported all product data and save this after that here we are getting one error here we are using all product. length so let's remove it and here we will type 300 + one and save it after that our error will be solved now if I open the web page here we don't have any product because our are is empty right now now we will fetch our all product data and we will store it in this all product State variable for that we will use the use effect and in this one we will pass one Aro function and I want this use effect to be loaded once when the component is mounted so here we will add the square bracket after that here we will add fetch Ai and in this fetch we will provide the API link that will be for the all product endpoint so we will add the HTTP colon sl/ Local Host 4,000 slash all products after that here we will use dot then and here we will get the response so we will type response and now we have to pass this response using Json method so we will type response. Json after that we will add dot then and here we will get the par data so we will save this data in all product that is the state variable so here we will add set all product and in this one we will pass our data now say save it and after that we will open the web browser if I come to main category here we have the main product and these products are coming from the API now if I open the image of any product you can see the product URL where we have the/ images SL product and some numbers this is coming from the port 4,000 that is our back end now our product is getting displayed on our e-commerce website from the API so till now we have used the login log out and all products API in our front end after that we will create the end point using that we can get this data new collection and popular items from the API for that we will come to index.js file where we have created the apis here we will add one comment and here we will type creating endpoint for new collection data here we will use app.get method and in this one we will provide the API endpoint path so here we will type SL new collections then we will pass one async Arrow function in this Arrow function parameter we will pass request and response after that we have to save all the products in one aray from the mongod DB database so we will add let products is equal to a weight and here we will use the product model dot find and in this find method we will provide one empty object after providing this empty object all the the products will be saved in this product array now we will slice this products array for that we will use let new collection is equal to products do slice and here we will provide one and again we will use slice and here we will use - 8 so using this in our new collection are we will get recently added a product and we will get the new collections product so after that we will add console log and we will add new collection fetched after that we will create a response and here we will send our new collection array so in this API we have stored all the products then we have added the newly added product in the new collection after that we have added console log to display this message new collection faced and after that we have send the new collection data as a response now we will test this new collection API so we will use the Thunder client and click on new request and here the method will we get and here we will add the endpoint address so we will type HTTP Local Host 4,000 then new collections then click on send button so here we are getting one error not found because we have not restarted our server so let's restart the server now if I click on send button so here we are getting the product ID 29 30 31 up to 36 so these are the new products added in our database now we will use these data for the product displayed here in this new collection component for that let's come back we will open components folder and in this one we have the new collections open this file new collections. jsx here we will create one state variable so we will type const and here we will add new collection and the seter function name will be set new collection equal to user State and we will initialize it with empty array after that we will remove this import and now save this so our new collections product has been removed we don't have any product in new collection now here we will add one use effect and in this use effect we will pass one Arrow function and here we will add square bracket so that the use effect will be executed only once and here we will add fetch API and this fetch we will pass one URL this is our new collection API URL paste it here after that we will add then method so in this one we will we will add response and we have to pass this response using Json method after that we will get the promise where we will have the par data so we will set this par data in the new collection so WR set new collection and we will provide the data now save this now you can see new collection faced it means the front end has faced this data now if I come to web page and in this new collection we have the products that we have recently added in our database to check this one let's come back to the admin folder and let's run this admin project so here we'll right click and select open in integrated terminal and we will run this admin panel so we'll add npm rund Dev now admin panel is running on this link let's open it and here we'll click on ADD product and here we will add a new product title that will be testing latest product new collection end point then we will add the price then category and then we will upload any image so we have selected this image then we'll click on ADD button so the product is successfully added and come back to the e-commerce front end website and refresh the website so in this new collection you can see the new product that we have just added you can see testing latest product new collection endpoint it means when we add a new product in the admin panel that will be displayed in this new collection now let me delete this tested product let's come back to the product list and remove it now we will refresh the website now the test product has been removed now we will add the end point for the popular in woman category so let's close this admin panel and here also we will close this admin panel now the back end is running and our front end is also running now close this file close this login sign up Navar and new request and here in this index.js we will create one Endo for popular in B category so here we will add creating end point for popular in wom section so here we will use app.get property and here we will add the endpoint path that will be SL popular in women after that we will pass one asnc Aro function and in this parameter we will pass request and response here also we will fetch all the product from the database so we will type let products equal to a weit and here we will use the product model and find method in this find method we will pass one object and here we will add category and in this category we will provide wom so when we use category woman it will search for the wom category from the product schema and all the products added in the wom category will be added in this products after that we will create one variable so let's add let popular in woman equal to and we will use this products array and here we will use dot slice method and here we will add the number of product so it will be 0 to four after that we will add console log and here we will add popular in woman fetched after that we will add response do send and in this one we will send this popular in women we will send this array now we can test this Endo so let's copy this and open Thunder client and click new request we will use the method get and here we will add the API link it will be/ poopular in before clicking on send button we will start the back end so we'll typ contrl C and we will use this line to this and now we'll click on send button so here we have the product that is four product and the category is women for all the four products the category is women now this popular in woman endpoint is successfully working now we will use this API endpoint to display the product on the front end so let's open the front end folder and in this one we'll go to popular component and open popular. jsx file and here we will create one state variable so we will type const popular products and the set function name will be set popular products equal to user State and initialize it with empty array after that we will remove this import statement and a sheet of data product we will add popular products are a then save the changes so here we don't have any product in the popular category so here we will add use effect and in this one we will pass one add function and I want this use effect to be executed ones so here we will add a square bracket and in this one we will add the Fetch and we will provide the API URL so let's add this then we will use the then method do then and here we will get the response and we have to pass this response using Json method so again we will get one promise so let's add dot then method and here we will get the parts data so we can use this data in the popular products so let's use that Setter function set popular product and here we will pass the data that's it here we have to add the parenthesis after that we will save the changes now open the web page and here let's refresh the web page and in this woman category you can see popular in women category product and these products are coming from this API link after that we will create the end point using that we can save the card product in the mongod DB database so here we will add one comment creating in point4 adding products in card data and here we will use app. poost property and here we will provide the endpoint path that will be slash add to cart after that here we will pass one as sync Arrow function so we will type as sync and in this parameter we will pass request and response so first we will come to sop context. JSM x file here we will remove this console log and here we will check if our local storage has the Au token so we will add local storage doget item Au token so if our local storage has this o token available it means we are logged in so when we are logged in in that case we will update this item ID in the mongodb database so let's come to the database page and we will click on browse collections if we open users and we will open this user and here we have the card data where we have one object and in this object we have 0 to 300 ID here if I add any Item ID in our card that we will send in the mongod DB database and we will stored it in the users card data for that in this if statement we will use the fet API in this F we will provide the add to card product API so we will add HTTP Local Host Port 4,000 and at the end point we will add add to cart then we will add one object and here we will Define the method that will be post after that we'll add headers in the headers we will store one object and here we will Define accept and here we will add application form data and after that we will provide the Au token so in this header we will add Au token and in this o token we will provide the token for that we will use the template literals and we will add the dollar sign curly presses so here we have added the backtick dollar sign curly bres and in this one we will provide the O token so we will add local storage. get item and here we will provide the key of o token that is O token so this is the key after adding the O token we will add content type and in this content type we will add application JS after that we will add the body property and in this body we will send the item ID so here we will send one object where we will add the field name Item ID and in this one we will send the item ID that we will get from this parameter and we will wrap it using json. stringy after sending this item id we need one response so we will add do then and we will add response so we will get the response and we will pass this response using Json method so we will type response. Json and we will get this pass data through promise so again we will add dot then and we will add data and for now we will just display play this data in console so we will add console.log and provide the data now save the changes now we will restart our server so here we have created one API for add to cut but we have not written Logic for this one so here first we have to log the request in console so we will add console.log and we will add request. body after that save the changes now we will restart the server now if I add any product in our e-commerce website front end so let's click on this product and click on add to cart now the product has been added in the cart and here in this back end we have the item ID that we have received in the body Now using the O token we will find the user and in their cart data we have to update the the data in 14 number object so for that we will add the logic we will take the O token and we will convert in user ID for that we will use one middleware or we will create a middleware so here let's add one comment and here we will type creating Middle where to fetch user here we will create one function so we will type const fetch user equal to and this will be one asnc Arrow function so let's type asnc Arrow function and here we will pass the parameter request and response and next now here we will create the logic in that we will take the Au token and we will verify that using JWT and we will find the user so let's add const token equal to request do header and here we will provide o token key name so our o token will be stored in this token variable so first we will check whether we got the token from user or not so let's add if and here we'll type if the token is not available in that case we will generate one response in that one we will add the respons status 41 then we will send one error message so in this one we will add one object and in this object we will add a key name that is errors and we will provide the string where we will add message please authenticate using valid token so if we are not getting token from the header then we will generate this status and we will send this error message after that if we got the token then we'll add the else condition and here we will add one try catch block and here we will decode the token so let's add one variable We'll add the con data is equal to and we'll use JWT library and in this Library we will use verify function now in this function we will pass our token and we will pass the salt with the help of that salt we have created one encrypted layer so the salt was secret Ecom now the token will be decoded using this salt and in that one the data we have that will be saved in this data variable using this data we can find the ID and we pass that in request so let's add request. user and in this one we will save data. user now we will execute the next function that we have passed in the parameter using this our token will be decoded and we will get the access of the user data in our request now we will use this middle bear in the add to cart so here we'll add fetch user and now the middle bear is attached now for this catch we will generate one response suppose we get any error in that case here we will display one error so using that error we can generate one response so let's type response dot a status and here we will use 41 and in this one we will send one error message and here we will add one object and here we will add errors and here we will add one string in this string we will type one message please authenticate using a valid token now in the console log we will display request do user now save the changes now we have to restart our backend server so we will type contrl c and we will reart our backend server now server running on Port 4,000 now we'll come to front end and we will refresh this web page and let's open any product and click on add to cart so here you can see the item ID and ID for the user using this user ID in our mongod DB database we'll find the user and in their card data we will increase the item ID by one now remove this console log and here we will use this user ID to find the user so here we will type let user data equal to await and here we will use users model and find one me method and in this find one method we will pass one object and in this object We'll add the key name that will beore ID and in this ID we will add the request dot user. ID so after adding this this complete object will be stored in this variable after that we will modify its cart data to modify the cart data here we will add user data Dot card data and here we'll pass the item ID so we will type request do body do Item ID and we will increase it with one after modifying the user data we have to save this data in the mongodb database so we will type await and here we will use user model dot find one find one and update method and here we will pass one object and here we will pass _ ID and in this ID we will provide request. user. ID after getting the user we will update the card data so we will add card data user data dot cart data after adding this this find one and update method we'll find the user and in their cart data it will update the data with modified data after that we will create one response so let's add response do send and in this send we will add one message added after that we will save the changes and we will rerun the backend server now we will reload the front end and we will open any product and click on add to cart so this product will be added in the cart and now we will open the mongod DB database refresh it and come to users and and in this user we will open the cart data so here we have the product number 29 and the product quantity is one it means the add to cart API is working in the back end here we have the product ID 29 and in the database you can see the product ID 29 in the card data and the number of product is one after that we'll create one AP endpoint to remove the product for that we will add one comment and here we will type creating Endo to remove product from cart data then we will use app. poost method and here we will provide the path of endpoint so just type SL remove from cart then we will pass our middle bear fetch user after that we will pass one asnc Aro function so we'll type A sync one Arrow function and in this parameter we will pass one request and response and here we will add the logic using that we can remove the product from our cart so we'll copy this logic and we will paste it here so here we'll get the user data using the ID after that we have to decrease this product y one so here we'll add minus equal to 1 and then we will save that data before removing it first we have to add one if statement where we will check if our user card data for that item ID is greater than zero then only we will perform this operation now we will save it and in this response we will send removed and here we will add one console log and here we will type removed and here we'll add one product ID so let's add request do body dot Item ID and save this similarly we will copy this console log and we will paste it here in the add to cart end point and here we will add added and here we will display the item id now we will save the changes and we will restart the server so we will press control C and we will run this again now now the back end is running after that we will add this remove from card functionality in our front end so we will open sop context. jsx file here we will check if our local storage has the Au token then we will add local storage. get item Au token it means if it is available in that case we will remove this product from the card and we will remove it from the database also so we will use the F API so as we have done in this add to card functionality let's copy this Fetch and we will paste it in this if statement and here we will change this endpoint it will be remove from cart after that we will save this file now we will open our web browser and now we will come to any product and let's click on add to card so we have the product ID 33 we have added this product so here reload this web page and in this user in the cart data we have product number 33 and number of product is one now we will come back and here in this cart if I click on this remove button and open the database again refresh the web page so here you can see in this card data product number 33 it is zero because it has been removed from the cart data so this remove from card functionality and remove from card API is successfully working after that we will create a logic so if we'll click on login in that case our cart data will be retrieved by default and all the data from the cart item stored in the database will be displayed in the cart for that we will create one API endpoint so here we will add one comment here we will type creating endpoint to get card data then we will use app. post property and here we will provide the endpoint path so we will type slash get cut after that we will add the middleware fetch user using this fetch user we will find the user ID from token and then we will pass one snc function and here we will add one Arrow function in this parameter we will pass the request and response so we will type request and response then we will add one message in console so we will add console.log get card after that using the user ID we will find the users card data so let's add let user data equal to await and here we will use the user model so using the users model we will add dot find one method and in this one we will pass one of object and here we will pass the ID and in this ID we will provide the request dot user. ID that we will get through middleware so using that we will get the users data stored in this user data now we will create one response using the Json property and here we will pass the user data dot cart data so after adding this from the users data we will pass the users card data as a response now we will link this API with our front end so for that we will come here sop context. jsx file here we will check if and here we will add the condition if the all token is available so using that o token we will fish the cart data also so let's add if local storage do get item and here we will provide the key that is O token if this token is available in the local storage in that case we will use Fetch and in this one we will add the get cart endpoint so we will type HTTP Local Host 4,000 get cart then we will add one object and here we will Define the method method will be post after that we will add header and in this headers we will add one object and in this object we will add accept and here we will provide the application and form data after that we will pass the Au token so we will type AU token and in this key property we will provide the token so we will use the template literal dollar sign curly bres and local storage dog item o token copy and paste it here so we will get the O token after that here we will add content type and we will set it as application Json after that we will add the body and in this body we will provide one empty string after that we will use dot then in this then method we will add response and we have to pass this response so just add response. Json it will also return One Promise so we will add dot then method and here we will add the data that will be the P data so we have to save this data in our cart items data so here we'll add set cart items and in this one we will provide our data so when the e-commerce web page will be loaded in that case all product will be fased and if the O token is available when we are logged in in that case this cart data will be fed from the database and it will be saved in s context and using that we will update the cart items in the cart page now to test it we will come back to the web page and here we are logged in so let's add some item in our cart so let's open the card page and here we have these product let's click on log out now the cart is zero you can see the cart page is empty now we'll log in using the same account we will add user 3. grest gmail.com this is the dummy email ID here we will add the password and click on login now we are logged in and here in this cart item you can see we have the same cart items that we have added it means the get cart API is successfully working now we have successfully created the get cart functionality now let's see the overview which apis we have created and what task we are performing so let's open the index.js file from the beginning first we have assigned one port number then we have added the express and then using this Express we have created one app then we have added we have initialized this Library using that we can use the mongod DB database then we have used JWT using that we can generate the token and we can verify the token after that we have in ized the molter using that we can create the image storage system so when we upload any image on this upload endpoint that will be stored in this upload folder after that we have initialized the path and here we have added cores to provide the access to react project after that we have added express.js in this app. using that whatever request we will get that will be passed using Json method after that we have added course in this use so using that we can get access to react front end to connect with the back end after that we have used the Mongo's library to connect the mongod DB database using this connection string after that we have created one API to check our Express app if I go to Port 4,000 we will get the message Express app is running then we have the image storage system and this is the API using that we can get the image after that we have created the model for the product using the Mongo's library after that we have created the add product API using that we can store the product in our database and here we have the remove product API using that we can remove the product by taking the product ID and then we have the all products API using that we can fetch all the products from our database then we have created the model for the users and using that user model we are creating the user account at this sign up end point after creating the sign up we are generating one token and we are sending this token as a response and this token is generated using this JWT do sign method after that we have created the login end point where we we are verifying the user ID and password from our database if the user is verified in that case we will generate one token using zwt do sign method and after that we will pass this token as a response after that we have created the new collections API in that we have added the Recently Added eight products and we are sending that product as a response similarly we have added the popular in wom category API we we are pitching the four product and we are sending these products as response then we have created the middleware using that we can convert the off token in user ID using this middleware we are adding the product in users cart data at this/ add to cart endpoint after that we are using the middleware to remove the product from the cart data SL remove from card API after that we have created the get card data using that when we login on the web page we will fetch the card data from the database and we will display that product in the front end here we have added code for Express app to listen at this port number so that we can run our backend server now we have successfully created the back end and integrated it with the front end and admin panel so here all the functionality are working fine we can navigate to different pages and we are getting the product from the API if I add any product in the cart and that product will be added in the card successfully if I remove that product will be deleted from the cart right now we have only one product with two quantity for this product if I click on log out and cart will become zero if I log in with the same user so we are logged in and if we go to cart page so our cart data has been retrieved from the database so finally we have successfully created this e-commerce website with front content and admin panel and we have connected it with the back end and we are managing all the database on mongodb at L database so I hope this video will be helpful for you if you have any question you can ask me in
